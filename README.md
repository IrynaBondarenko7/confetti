## Burger Menu

The burger menu includes a close button and navigation menu. Each menu item is clickable, providing a smooth scroll to the corresponding section on the page.

## Hero (Główna)

In addition to the main content, this section features a light animation of balloons for added visual appeal.

## About Us (O nas)

The card layout is created using the CSS Grid algorithm. On mobile devices, the section functions as a slider, allowing users to change slides by clicking on pagination or by dragging.

## Reviews (Recenzje)

Users can navigate between slides by clicking on buttons or pagination. Clicking the button toggles to the next slide.

## Contacts (Kontakty)

The form is validated, with the Name and Email fields being mandatory, while the Message field is optional.

## Footer

The responsive layout spans from mobile (360px to 480px) with a flexible design, to tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px). It includes the logo, copyright information, and utilizes React, Swiper, Styled Components, Formik, and Yup.
